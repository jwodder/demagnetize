``demagnetize`` is a Python program for converting one or more BitTorrent
`magnet links`_ into ``.torrent`` files by downloading the torrent info from
active peers.

.. _magnet links: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme

At the moment, ``demagnetize`` only supports basic features of the BitTorrent
protocol.  The following notable features are supported:

- BitTorrent protocol v1
- HTTP (including compact and IPv6 extensions) and UDP trackers
- magnet URIs with info hashes encoded in either hexadecimal or base32
- Fast extension (`BEP 6`_)
- UDP tracker protocol extensions (`BEP 41`_)

.. _BEP 6: https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0006.html
.. _BEP 41: https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0041.html

The following features are not currently supported but are planned, in no
particular order:

- Encryption
- Distributed hash tables
- BitTorrent protocol v2
- ``x.pe`` parameters in magnet links
- uTP

``demagnetize`` has also been translated by the author into Rust; you can find
the Rust version at <https://github.com/jwodder/demagnetize-rs>.


Installation
============
``demagnetize`` requires Python 3.10 or higher.  Just use `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ for Python 3 (You have pip, right?) to install it::

    python3 -m pip install demagnetize


Usage
=====

::

    demagnetize [<global options>] <subcommand> ...

The ``demagnetize`` command has two subcommands, ``get`` (for converting a
single magnet link) and ``batch`` (for converting a file of magnet links), both
detailed below.

Global Options
--------------

-l LEVEL, --log-level LEVEL
                        Set the log level to the given value.  Possible values
                        are "``CRITICAL``", "``ERROR``", "``WARNING``",
                        "``INFO``", "``DEBUG``", and "``TRACE``" (all
                        case-insensitive).  [default value: ``INFO``]


``demagnetize get``
-------------------

::

    demagnetize [<global options>] get [<options>] <magnet-link>

Convert a single magnet link specified on the command line to a ``.torrent``
file.  (Note that you will likely have to quote the link in order to prevent it
from being interpreted by the shell.)  By default, the file is saved at
``{name}.torrent``, where ``{name}`` is replaced by the value of the ``name``
field from the torrent info, but a different path can be set via the
``--outfile`` option.

Options
^^^^^^^

-o PATH, --outfile PATH
                        Save the ``.torrent`` file to the given path.  The path
                        may contain a ``{name}`` placeholder, which will be
                        replaced by the (sanitized) name of the torrent, and/or
                        a ``{hash}`` placeholder, which will be replaced by the
                        torrent's info hash in hexadecimal.  Specifying ``-``
                        will cause the torrent to be written to standard
                        output.  [default: ``{name}.torrent``]


``demagnetize batch``
---------------------

::

    demagnetize [<global options>] batch [<options>] <file>

Read magnet links from ``<file>``, one per line (ignoring empty lines and lines
that start with ``#``), and convert each one to a ``.torrent`` file.  By
default, each file is saved at ``{name}.torrent``, where ``{name}`` is replaced
by the value of the ``name`` field from the torrent info, but a different path
can be set via the ``--outfile`` option.

Options
^^^^^^^

-o PATH, --outfile PATH
                        Save the ``.torrent`` files to the given path.  The
                        path may contain a ``{name}`` placeholder, which will
                        be replaced by the (sanitized) name of each torrent,
                        and/or a ``{hash}`` placeholder, which will be replaced
                        by each torrent's info hash in hexadecimal.  [default:
                        ``{name}.torrent``]
